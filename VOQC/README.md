# VOQC

## Overview

This README contains general instructions for compiling and running the VOQC optimizer. For instructions on running VOQC on the benchmarks in the VOQC paper, see [benchmarks/README.md](benchmarks/README.md).

VOQC currently supports the following gates:
* t, tdg
* s, sdg
* z
* rzq(num,den)
* rz(f * pi)
* h
* x
* cnot

rzq is a non-standard gate that we have defined specifically for VOQC. rzq(num,den) performs a rotation about the z-axis by ((num /den) * pi) for integers num and den. We have defined the gate this way to avoid floating point numbers, which significantly complicate verification. Gates of the form rz(f * pi) are automatically converted into our rzq form by converting the float f to its rational representation.

The Coq source code for our optimizer is in src/. The code for extracting our Coq optimizations to OCaml (and optionally wrapping in a C library) is in extraction/. interop/ contains code for calling VOQC functions from Python (see below).

## Compilation

Dependencies:
  * OCaml version >= 4.08.1 
  * dune (`opam install dune`)
  * zarith (`opam install zarith`)
  * batteries (`opam install batteries`)
  * OCaml OpenQASM parser (`opam install openQASM`)

**OCaml Executable**: In the top (`..`) directory, run `make voqc`. This will compile the OCaml code we have extracted from our verified Coq code. If you have modified the Coq code, then be sure to run `make optimizer` first. If you want to compile the code without using our Makefile you can use the command `dune build voqc.exe` in the current (VOQC) directory. This will produce `voqc.exe` in _build/default/.

**Library**: Run `dune build extraction/libvoqc.so` in the current (VOQC) directory. This will produce `libvoqc.so` in _build/default/extraction/.

*Notes*: 
* If you are building the voqc executable or library on a Mac, you will likely see the warning `ld: warning: directory not found for option '-L/opt/local/lib'`. This is due to zarith (see [ocaml/opam-repository#3000](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues/3000)) and seems to be fine to ignore.
* If you get an error like the following, try looking for a `dune-project` file outside of the VOQC directory (e.g. in the extraction directory). Deleting this file usually solves the problem.
  ```
  File "dune", line 3, characters 13-27:
  3 |   (libraries extracted_code))
                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  Error: Library "extracted_code" not found.
  ```

## Running the VOQC Executable

To run the OCaml optimizer, run `dune exec -- ./voqc.exe -i <prog> -o <out>`, which will optimize program prog and write the optimized result to out. It will print the initial and final gate counts.

*Example*: The following runs VOQC on the tof_3 benchmark and writes the result to out.qasm.
```
$ dune exec -- ./voqc.exe -i benchmarks/VOQC-benchmarks/Arithmetic_and_Toffoli/tof_3.qasm -o out.qasm 
Input file: benchmarks/VOQC-benchmarks/Arithmetic_and_Toffoli/tof_3.qasm
Output file: out.qasm
Time to parse: 0.000149s
Original:	 Total 45, Rz 21, Clifford 0, T 21, H 6, X 0, CNOT 18
Time to optimize: 0.000568s
Final:	 Total 40, Rz 18, Clifford 3, T 15, H 6, X 0, CNOT 16
Time to write out: 0.000758s
```
VOQC reports, in order: total gate count, number of z-axis rotation gates, number of Clifford gate (= rotations by multiples of PI/2), number of T gates, number of H gates, number of X gates, and number of CNOT gates.

Scripts for running VOQC on the benchmarks presented in our paper are available in the [benchmarks](benchmarks) directory.

## Using the VOQC Library in Python

The voqc.py file in the interop/ directory provides a wrapper around the VOQC library functions. Here is an example of using it.

```
from interop.voqc import SQIR

# load circuit
c = SQIR("benchmarks/VOQC-benchmarks/Arithmetic_and_Toffoli/tof_3.qasm")

# run a single optimization (in this case, X propagation)
c.not_propagation()

# run all optimizations
c.optimize()

# write the optimized file
c.write("out.qasm")
```

The run_voqc.py file in the current directory provides a wrapper about the voqc.py library and should have the same behavior as the VOQC executable described above.
